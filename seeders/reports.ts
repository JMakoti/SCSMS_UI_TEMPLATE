    "Offline-first desktop application for sub-county school information management",
  executiveSummary:
    "The system helps education officers manage schools, staff, students, enrollment, infrastructure, contacts and administrative reports from one centralized Windows desktop application. It is designed for unreliable internet environments, stores operational data locally in SQLite, and synchronizes with an online PostgreSQL database through a controlled sync API.",
  architecture: ["Next.js", "Tauri", "SQLite", "Sync API", "PostgreSQL"],
  primaryGoal:
    "Develop a reliable offline-first school management system that remains fully usable without internet access while maintaining a synchronized online copy of the data.",
  objectives: [
    "Centralize school, enrollment, staff, contacts and infrastructure records.",
    "Support continuous offline work on a dedicated Windows computer.",
    "Synchronize local changes with an online PostgreSQL database.",
    "Provide dashboards, search, filtering, reports, import, export and backups.",
    "Track important record changes through audit history and sync status.",
